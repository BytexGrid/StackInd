          "steps": [
            "1. **Charging Batteries:**
              "- **Dedicated Charger:** Most cameras come with a dedicated external battery charger. Insert the battery into the charger, ensuring correct orientation. Plug the charger into a power outlet. Observe the indicator light (usually orange/red for charging, green for fully charged).
              "- **In-Camera Charging (USB):** Many modern mirrorless cameras support in-camera charging via a USB-C cable connected to a wall adapter or power bank. Connect the camera to the power source. The camera's screen or an indicator light will show charging status. This can be slower than a dedicated charger.",
            "2. **Insert Battery into Camera:** Once fully charged, insert the battery into the camera's battery compartment, typically located at the bottom. Ensure it clicks into place securely and the release latch engages.",
            "3. **Power Bank Usage (for USB charging cameras):**
              "- Connect a compatible power bank (ensure it outputs sufficient power, often PD - Power Delivery compatible for faster charging) to your camera's USB-C port.",
              "- The camera will draw power from the power bank, either charging the internal battery or directly powering the camera, depending on the model and settings.",
            "4. **Battery Care and Storage:**
              "- **Cycle Batteries:** Fully charge and discharge batteries occasionally to maintain their health. Avoid letting them sit completely drained for extended periods.",
              "- **Storage:** Store batteries in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. For long-term storage, charge them to around 50-60% (check manufacturer recommendations) to prolong their lifespan.",
              "- **Avoid Extreme Temperatures:** Do not expose batteries to extreme heat or cold, as this can degrade performance and lifespan.",
              "- **Genuine Batteries:** While third-party batteries can be cheaper, genuine manufacturer batteries often offer better performance, safety, and longevity. If using third-party, choose reputable brands.",
              "- **Check Contacts:** Periodically clean battery contacts with a dry, lint-free cloth to ensure good connection."

            "2. **Install Software:**
              "- **Download Software:** Visit the manufacturer's website (Datacolor or X-Rite) for your specific device model. Download the latest calibration software.",
              "  - **Windows:** Download the `.exe` installer. Run and follow the on-screen prompts. The software will install necessary drivers and applications.",
              "  - **macOS:** Download the `.dmg` installer. Drag the application icon to your 'Applications' folder. You may need to grant accessibility permissions in System Settings/Preferences.",
            "3. **Prepare Your Monitor:**
              "- **Warm-up:** Turn on your monitor at least 30 minutes before calibration to allow it to stabilize.",
              "- **Reset Settings:** If possible, reset your monitor to its factory default settings. Turn off any dynamic contrast or adaptive brightness features.",
              "- **Clean Screen:** Gently clean your monitor screen with a microfiber cloth.",
              "- **Ambient Light:** Perform calibration in the lighting conditions you typically work in. Avoid direct sunlight or strong glare on the screen.",
            "4. **Launch Calibration Software:** Open the installed calibration software (e.g., 'SpyderUtility', 'i1Profiler').",
            "5. **Follow On-Screen Prompts:** The software will guide you through the calibration process:",
              "- **Choose Settings:** Select target settings for brightness (e.g., 80-120 cd/m² for print, higher for web), white point (e.g., D65/6500K for standard daylight, or native), and gamma (e.g., 2.2).",
              "- **Place Device:** The software will instruct you to hang the calibration device over your monitor screen, ensuring it sits flat and is flush against the screen surface in the designated area (usually the center).",
              "- **Begin Measurement:** The device will then take a series of color and brightness readings, displaying progress on screen. This process can take several minutes.",
            "6. **Profile Creation:** Once measurements are complete, the software will create a new ICC (International Color Consortium) profile for your monitor. This profile contains the color corrections needed for accurate display.",
            "7. **Save Profile & Set as Default:** Save the new profile and ensure it is set as the default display profile for your operating system. The software usually handles this automatically.",
            "8. **Review Results:** The software may offer a 'before and after' comparison to show the impact of the calibration. Your screen should now display colors accurately.",
            "9. **Schedule Recalibration:** Monitors drift over time. Schedule recalibration every 2-4 weeks for professional work, or every 1-2 months for general use."

          "description": "Steps to install and set up a graphics tablet for photo editing.",
          "steps": [
            "1. **Unbox & Connect Tablet:**
              "- Carefully unbox the graphics tablet, stylus, and USB cable (or power cable for display tablets).",
              "- Connect the tablet to your computer via the provided USB cable. For some wireless tablets, you might need to insert a USB receiver into your computer.",
              "- For display tablets (e.g., Wacom Cintiq, Huion Kamvas), connect both the USB cable and the video cable (HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C Display Alt Mode) to your computer and plug in the power adapter.",
            "2. **Install Drivers:**
              "- **Crucial Step:** Do NOT rely on built-in OS drivers. Go to the manufacturer's official support website (Wacom, Huion, XP-Pen). Find the 'Drivers' or 'Support' section.",
              "- **Select Model & OS:** Select your specific tablet model and operating system (Windows/macOS).",
              "- **Download Latest Drivers:** Download the latest drivers. It's recommended to uninstall any old tablet drivers first if you had a previous tablet.",
              "- **Run Installer:**
                "  - **Windows:** Run the downloaded `.exe` installer. Follow the on-screen prompts. Restart your computer if prompted.",
                "  - **macOS:** Run the downloaded `.pkg` or `.dmg` installer. Drag the application to Applications if prompted. You will likely need to grant significant permissions (Accessibility, Input Monitoring, Full Disk Access) in System Settings/Preferences > Security & Privacy. Follow the on-screen instructions carefully to grant these permissions and restart your computer.",
            "3. **Configure Tablet Software:**
              "- **Launch Tablet Settings:** After installation and reboot, launch the tablet's settings application (e.g., 'Wacom Tablet Properties', 'Huion Tablet').",
              "- **Customize Pen Buttons:** Assign functions to the buttons on your stylus (e.g., right-click, undo, brush size).",
              "- **Customize Tablet Buttons (if present):** If your tablet has express keys or customizable buttons, assign shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Z, Spacebar for Pan, specific Photoshop tools).",
              "- **Adjust Pressure Sensitivity:** Test and adjust the pen's pressure curve to match your drawing style. This is vital for painting opacity, brush size, or flow in Photoshop.",
              "- **Mapping:** For non-display tablets, ensure the tablet's active area is correctly mapped to your monitor(s). For dual monitors, you can map it to a single monitor or across both.",
            "4. **Integrate with Photo Editing Software:**
              "- **Photoshop:** Open Photoshop. Ensure 'Tablet Preferences' or 'Pen Pressure' is enabled for your brushes (look for the pen pressure icon in the brush settings or options bar).",
              "- **Lightroom:** While less critical, a tablet can be used for local adjustments like brush strokes in Lightroom.",
            "5. **Practice:** Using a graphics tablet takes practice to develop muscle memory. Start with simple tasks like dodging and burning, then move to complex masking and retouching."
