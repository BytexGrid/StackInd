      "general_installation_procedure": [
        "**1. Download Plugin Installer:** Visit the official website of the plugin developer (e.g., [Waves Downloads](https://www.waves.com/downloads), [FabFilter Downloads](https://www.fabfilter.com/downloads), [iZotope Downloads](https://www.izotope.com/en/downloads.html), [Native Instruments Downloads](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/support/downloads/)). Download the installer for the specific plugin(s) you purchased or want to trial.",
        "**2. Run Installer:** Execute the downloaded installer file (`.exe` on Windows, `.dmg` on macOS). Follow the on-screen prompts. This typically involves:",
        "   * Accepting the End-User License Agreement (EULA).",
        "   * Choosing the plugin formats to install (VST, VST3, AU, AAX - select all that your DAW supports).",
        "   * Specifying installation locations (usually default paths are fine, but some users prefer custom folders for VST plugins).",
        "   * Installing any associated helper applications or content.",
        "**3. Authorization/Activation:** This is the most varied step. Common methods include:",
        "   * **License Manager Application:** Many developers use their own license managers (e.g., [Waves Central](https://www.waves.com/downloads/waves-central), [Native Access](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/specials/native-access/), [iZotope Product Portal](https://www.izotope.com/en/downloads/product-portal.html), [Arturia Software Center](https://www.arturia.com/support/asc), [Universal Audio Connect](https://www.uaudio.com/software/uad/connect)). Launch this application, log in with your account, and activate your purchased plugins. This often involves downloading the plugin data and applying the license.",
        "   * **iLok:** Many professional plugins (including some Waves, Soundtoys, etc.) use PACE iLok. You'll need an [iLok account](https://www.ilok.com/) and sometimes a physical iLok USB dongle. Licenses are transferred from your developer account to your iLok account, and then activated to your computer or physical iLok via the [iLok License Manager application](https://www.ilok.com/#!license-manager).",
        "   * **Serial Number/Challenge-Response:** Some older or smaller developers use direct serial number entry or a challenge-response system where you copy a 'challenge' code from the plugin, paste it onto a website to get a 'response' code, and then paste that back into the plugin.",
        "   * **Key File:** A license file (e.g., `.lic` or `.key`) downloaded from your account that you place in a specific folder or load directly within the plugin.",
        "**4. DAW Scan:** After installation and activation, open your DAW.",
        "   * Go to your DAW's 'Preferences' or 'Settings' (e.g., 'VST Plugins' in Ableton Live, 'Plugin Manager' in Logic Pro, 'Locations' in Pro Tools).",
        "   * Perform a 'Rescan' or 'Scan for New Plugins'. Your DAW will locate the newly installed plugins and make them available in your plugin list.",
        "**5. Content Installation (for Virtual Instruments):** For large virtual instruments (e.g., Native Instruments Kontakt libraries, Spitfire Audio libraries, Spectrasonics Omnisphere), you will typically need to download and install large sound libraries in addition to the plugin itself. These are usually managed by the developer's license manager or a dedicated content downloader (e.g., [Native Instruments Native Access](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/specials/native-access/), [Spitfire Audio App](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/info/faq/spitfire-audio-app/)).
